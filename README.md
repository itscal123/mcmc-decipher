# mcmc-decipher
Use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to generate a cipher key that best deciphers some encoded text. Encoded text can either be user input or preselected text prompts.

Currently working with substiution cipher for the encryption and Metroplis-Hastings for MCMC. 

## Future Goals:
    Use more difficult cipher (e.g., transposition or substitution-transposition)
    Use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

## Cherry on top:
    Create a front end
    
## Installation
Install neccessary packages using the command 
    $pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the program
After succesfully installing the project and all relevant packages, simply run main.py.
