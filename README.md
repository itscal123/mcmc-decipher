# mcmc-decipher
Use MCMC to generate a decipher key, given some encrypted text (either user input or provided text).

Currently working with substiution cipher for the encryption and Metroplis-Hastings for MCMC. 

## Current Goals:
    - Improve score function
    - Optimize code (using numpy)
    - Use more difficult ciphers
    - Increase data corpus
    - Use more difficult cipher (e.g., transposition or substitution-transposition)
    - Use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

## Cherry on top:
    - Create a front end
