# mcmc-decipher
Use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to generate a cipher key that best deciphers some encoded text. Encoded text can either be user input or preselected text prompts.

Currently working with substiution cipher for the encryption and Metroplis-Hastings for MCMC. 

## Current Goals:
    Improve score function
    Optimize code (using numpy)
    Use more difficult ciphers
    Increase data corpus
    Use more difficult cipher (e.g., transposition or substitution-transposition)
    Use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

    Create a front end
    
## Installation
TODO

## Running the program
After succesfully installing the project and all relevant packages, simply run main.py.
